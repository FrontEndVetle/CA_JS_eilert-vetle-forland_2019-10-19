//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?

Function literals are anonymous and they have no name by default but you can give them a name by  linking them to a variable. You can use a functin literal to pass an argument to a method when you dont want to define a separate function. 

2. What is the constructor?

A constructor is for instance a prototype you can use as a "template" when creating new objects. You can call on the constructor function to easy create new objects without having to write the whole function again.

3. What does the return statement do?

The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from what the function is instructed to do, depending on which value you vant to have returned. 



4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();


"Inside my function".

5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.

In Javascript there are 2 scopes. The local scope and the global scope. The scope determains if the variable is visable or not for to be used. If it is a global scope you can use the variable everywhere. On a local scope where you have the variable inside a function it can only be used by that function or its children.
